Right now you can force a draw from the opening with the Amar opening (Nh3, Na3, and going back)

I can play as the computer by using my unmake_move feature (right click)

Need to remove a lot of troublesome lines in the opening book that just straight up hang a piece

To Do:
1. unmake move
2. the evaluation hash table only needs to hash the piece locations and the turn, so maybe have a phash
value in the board struct that we update along with the other hash value that just stores this info
3. redo how pins work... its a huge waste of space... I only even need one pin struct since it changes

it might be worth it to see how many total nodes are being evaluated on a given search
to see if move generation speeds are even making a difference there
